# dStar_basic_runs
Basic dStar runs for several cooling curve sources.

Each directory corresponds to one source. Accretion outbursts are modelled using a constant accretion rate equal to the average observed rate for the duration of the outburst. Other epochs in the `accretion_history` file correspond to observations of the surface temperature, for easier comparison to observational data.

At the end of the run, it will print out the effective temperatures for each epoch specified in the `accretion_history` file.

By default, each run produces history output for each dStar interval.
